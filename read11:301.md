## nosql vs sql

- No doubt the size of data used or transferred is becoming larger and larger every day, it is estimated that “There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). Over the last two years alone 90 percent of the data in the world was generated” according to Forbes (Links to an external site.), dealing with such amount of data is not only challenging, but also defines the way the internet will look like in future.

- For grouping or arranging data there are a lot of data base, most known are MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB, which can be divided into two main categories:

1. SQL (structured query language)

2. NoSQL

# What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage

# Give a real world example

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

# What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.

# Give a real world example.?

MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb,

Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb*

# Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NOSQL database .

# Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases

# What does SQL stand for?

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems

# What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

# What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each having a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Thus a table represents a collection of relationships. There is a direct correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation

# What is a ‘schema’?

A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database. It can exist both as a visual representation and as a set of formulas known as integrity constraints that govern a database. These formulas are expressed in a data definition language, such as SQL. As part of a data dictionary, a database schema indicates how the entities that make up the database relate to one another, including tables, views, stored procedures, and more.

# What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

# how does it work?

NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases

# What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents

# Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. Collections do not enforce document structure by default. This flexibility gives you data-modeling choices to match your application and its performance requirements. ... MongoDB provides the capability for schema validation during updates and insertions

# What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

1. MongoDB uses high memory for data storage.

2. There is a limit for document size, i.e. 16mb.

3. There is no transaction support in MongoDB.
