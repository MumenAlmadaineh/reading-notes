# Related Resources and Integration Testing

## Relations 
- One-to-One Relationship
- One-to-Many Relationship
- Many-to-Many Relationship

*  The Repositories
to expose these entities as resources, let's create two repository interfaces for each of them, by extending the CrudRepository interface
>public interface LibraryRepository extends CrudRepository<Library, Long> {}
>public interface AddressRepository extends CrudRepository<Address, Long> {}
* Creating the Associations
This is done using the HTTP method PUT, which supports a media type of text/uri-list, and a body containing the URI of the resource to bind to the association

* To remove an association
>curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/libraryAddress


1. One-to-one relationships

![one to one](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/java-ee-tutorial/jpa/one-to-one/images/one-one.png)

In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table

2. One-to-Many Relationship

![One-to-Many](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/java-ee-tutorial/jpa/many-to-one/images/many-one.png)

In a one-to-many relationship, one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table

3.  Many-to-Many Relationship

![Many-to-Many](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/java-ee-tutorial/jpa/many-to-many/images/many-to-many.png)

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table.


## Intergration Testing in Spring

![Intergration Testing in Spring](https://i.morioh.com/210622/dbf679fe.webp)

### Enable Test with JUnit5

- JUnit 5 define an extension interface through which classes can integrate with the JUnit test
- enable this extension by adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and specifying the extenion class to load.
- To run the Spring test, we use `SpringExtension.class`

```
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = { ApplicationConfig.class })
@WebAppConfiguration
public class GreetControllerIntegrationTest {
    ....
}
```

- add the `ApplicationConfig.class` to the `@ContextConfiguration` which will load the configs for that particular test.
- `WebAppConfiguration` will load the web application context.

### WebApplicationContext Object

- provide a web application configuration.
- loads all the application bans and controllers into the context.

```
@Autowired
private WebApplicationContext webApplicationContext;
```

### Mocking Web Context Beans

- provides support for Spring MVC testing.
- encapsulates all web application beans and makes them available for testing.
- initialze the mockMvc object in the `@BeforeEach` annoation method

```
private MockMvc mockMvc;
@BeforeEach
public void setup() throws Exception {
    this.mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.webApplicationContext).build();
}
```

### Writing Integration test

####  Verify View Name

```
@Test
public void givenHomePageURI_whenMockMVC_thenReturnsIndexJSPViewName() {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/homePage")).andDo(print())
      .andExpect(view().name("index"));
}
```

#### Verify Response Body

```
@Test
public void givenGreetURI_whenMockMVC_thenVerifyResponse() {
    MvcResult mvcResult = this.mockMvc.perform(get("/greet"))
      .andDo(print()).andExpect(status().isOk())
      .andExpect(jsonPath("$.message").value("Hello World!!!"))
      .andReturn();
    
    Assert.assertEquals("application/json;charset=UTF-8", 
      mvcResult.getResponse().getContentType());
}
```
