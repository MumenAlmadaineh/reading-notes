# Learn about expressions and operators in JavaScript

## The articles below contains expressions and operators in JavaScript

### First let's have a look about operators

### What is an Operator?

- ### Operators are used for comparing values, perform arithmetic operations, etc. For example, if we take a simple expression, 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript consists of different types of operators that are used to perform different operations.

- ### Types of JavaScript Operators: -

- #### There are different types of operators in JavaScript that are used for performing different operations. Some of the JavaScript Operators include:

1. ## Arithmetic Operators:

Operator  | Description | Example
----------| ------------| -------------
`+` | Adds two operands   | `10 + 5` = 15
`-` | Subtracts the second operand from the first   | `10 - 5` = 5
`*` | Multiply two operands   | `10 * 5` = 50
`/` | Divide the numerator by the denominator   | `10 / 5` = 2
`%` | Outputs the remainder of an integer division   | `10 % 5` = 0
`++` | Increases an integer value by one   | `var a=15; a++;` Now a = 16
`—` | Decreases an integer value by one   | `var a=15; a–;` Now a = 14

2. ## Assignment Operators:

Operator  | Description | Example
----------| ------------| -------------
`=` | Assigns values from the right side operand to the left side operand   | `10 + 5` = 15
`+=` | It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand   | `var a=10; a+=5;` Now a = 15
`-=` | 	It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand   | `var a=10; a-=5;` Now a = 5
`/=` | It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand   | `var a=10; a/=2;` Now a = 5
`%=` | It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand   | `var a=10; a%=2;` Now a = 0

3. ## Comparison Operators

Operator  | Description | Example
----------| ------------| -------------
`==` | 	
Checks if two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true   | `10==5` = false
`===` | Finds the identical (equal and of the same type)   | `10===10` = true
`!=` | Checks if two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true   | `5!=10` = true
`!==` | It implies that two values are not Identical   | `10!==10` = false
`>` | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand  | `10>5` = true
`<` | This Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand   | `10<=5` = false
`>=` | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand   | `10>=5` = true
`<=` | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand   | `10<=5` = false

4. Logical Operators:

Operator  | Description | Example
----------| ------------| -------------
`&&` | Logical AND – If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true   | (`5==10 && 5==13`) = false
`||` | Logical OR – If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true  | (`5==10 || 5==13`) = false
`!` | Logical NOT – Reverses the logical state of its operand | !(`5==10`) = true

### *Now if you are finished read previous topic then this topic will be very easy to understand.*

2. ## Expressions:

- ***An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.***

- ###### Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

- ###### The expression x = 5 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value five to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to five.

- ###### The code 3 + 2 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and two together without assigning the result, five, to a variable.
