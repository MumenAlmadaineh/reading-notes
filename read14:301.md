## Authentication
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

OAuth allows websites and services to share assets among users. It is widely accepted, but be aware of its vulnerabilities.

OAuth definition
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

OAuth history
Created and strongly supported from the start by Twitter, Google and other companies, OAuth was released as an open standard in 2010 as RFC 5849, and quickly became widely adopted. Over the next two years, it underwent substantial revision, and version 2.0 of OAuth, was released in 2012 as RFC 6749. Even though version 2.0 was widely criticized for multiple reasons covered below, it gained even more popularity. Today, you can add Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Paypal and a list of other internet who’s-whos as adopters.


## What is OpenID?

OpenID is about authentication, OpenID is for humans logging into machines.
 (Links to an external site.)Authorization and Authentication flows
 (Links to an external site.)What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
 (Links to an external site.)What is Authorization Code Flow?
exchanges an Authorization Code for a token
 (Links to an external site.)What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
During authentication, mobile and native applications can use the Authorization Code Flow, but they require additional security. Additionally, single-page apps have special challenges. To mitigate these, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
 (Links to an external site.)What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
It does offer a streamlined workflow if the application needs only an ID token to perform user authentication.
 (Links to an external site.)What is Client Credentials Flow?
With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user. For this scenario, typical authentication schemes like username + password or social logins don't make sense.
 (Links to an external site.)What is Device Authorization Flow?
With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text.
 (Links to an external site.)What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
