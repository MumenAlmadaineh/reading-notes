An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

REST design principles :

Layered system architecture.

Cacheability

Statelessness.

Client-server decoupling.

Uniform interface

What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

HTTP

`https://adventure-works.com/orders/1 (Links to an external site.)`

What are the most common HTTP verbs?

The most common operations (verbs) are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
What should the URIs be based on?

resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
Give an example of a good URI.

`https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good`



`https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid`

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

"chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources, So it's a bad thing.
What status code does a successful GET request return?

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK)
What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).
What status code does a successful POST request return?

If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created)
What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content)

RESTful web API design
Representational State Transfer (REST), REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client. A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:
