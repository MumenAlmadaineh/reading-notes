Variables in java used to store values in computers memory and there is a number of type from it you can see it in the above photo.

### Operators in java
In Java we can assign values to Variables, threre is a number of types for Operators you can see it in the above photo.

### Expressions, Statements, and Blocks in java

> (Java Documentation) Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks. This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already seen.

### Control Flow Statements

### Compiling in java

> (Reddit) everything in a computer is represented by a series of 1's and 0's (which themselves represent high and low voltages on transistors, but that's a topic for another time). When the computer runs a program, the program itself is made of a bunch of 1's and 0's.
However, since we still need humans to write our programs, putting everything in 1's and 0's (called machine language) would be very difficult. So we made higher level languages like Java and C# to write code in. These languages look a lot more like English, so they're a lot easier to write and maintain.
When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language). The very short version could be, yes, compile means to make the code executable.
Something you may run into is people saying code does or does not compile. This means the compilor they used checks to make sure their program is written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. For example, most programming languages make you put a semicolon (;) at the end of every line. A very common mistake is to forget that semicolon, so when you try and compile the compilor gives you an error.
It's also important to note that just because the code compiles doesn't mean it works. It's sort of like how 3 + 4 < 5 is an equation that has the right form, but it is incorrect.
