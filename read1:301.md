### advantages of using component based architecture

1. Extensible

A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

2. Replaceable

Components may be readily substituted with other similar components.

3. Encapsulated

Components exposes interfaces which allow the caller to use its functionality and hides the details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

4. Independent

Components are independent. It can be designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

5. Reusable

Components are designed to be reused in different scenarios in different applications.

6. Not Context Specific

Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts. Specific information such as state data, should be passed to the component instead of being included in or accessed by the component.
