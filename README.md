- First, let me ask you a question

- Do you know what is **the growth mindset** and, how it's different from **the fixed mindset**?
### ***The growth mindset and the fixed mindset*** it's the way how you are thinking about the problems that you face in your life.*

**So if you think** that the factors of success and failure in life come with a person since his birth And no one can acquire it, in this case, you think in a way the fixed mindset **but if you believe** that the reasons for success and failure are gained through training, self-development, and listening to all opinions without fanaticism, then you have the growth mindset.
