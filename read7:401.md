# HTTP Request

### **The HTTP Request Lifecycle:**

**Step 1: Local Processing**

1. Your browser extracts the "scheme"/protocol, host , and optional port number, resource path, and query strings that are specified in the form.

2. The browser will then look through its own cache of recently requested URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, your router’s cache, and your DNS cache.

**Step 2: Resolve an IP**

1. If the cache lookup fails, your browser fires off a DNS request using UDP3.

2. the request will now have to travel many network devices to reach

3. Once the request arrives at your configured DNS server, the server looks for the address associated with the requested hostname.

4. the requesting client now has a target IP. It will also have received a piece of information as part of the answer that will let it know how long the returned answer can be cached for.

**Step 3: Establish a TCP Connection**

1. delivery and ordered data transmission. done using a sequence number for every byte sent.

2. TCP connections are opened using what’s known as a three-way handshake.

3. concurrent communication along the connection, which is also known as full duplex communication.

**Step 4: Send an HTTP Request**

1. Send a request made up of a "request line", request header, and a body. The header of the request is made up of pairs in the form name:value `<CR><LF>`. Two consecutive `<CR><LF>` pairs indicate the end of the header section.

2. The request follows a similar routing procedure, with the difference being that using TCPs magic sequence number powers.

3. Once the server receives the request, processes it, and finds the resource being requested, it generates an HTTP response.

4. Once the response is generated, the server responds to the request. At the TCP layer, the client receives the first data packet, the first byte of which should contain the HTTP response header.

**Step 5: Tearing Down and Cleaning Up**

1. The client sends a FIN packet, to which the server responds, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the client responds to. The client then waits for a brief timeout, during which it cannot accept new connections, to prevent delayed packets from previous connections arriving during subsequent activities on the port.

2. At this point, the browser begins processing what it has received. If it is an image, data, or other media file that is being consumed by some application inside the browser, a variety of things can happen.

## performing HTTP requests in Java using HttpUrlConnection java class :

- create a connection to a given URL using GET method:

 `URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
con.setRequestMethod("GET");`

-  Adding Request Parameters:

`Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<>();
parameters.put("param1", "val");
con.setDoOutput(true);
DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream());
out.writeBytes(ParameterStringBuilder.getParamsString(parameters));
out.flush();
out.close();`

###### To facilitate the transformation of the parameter Map, we have written a utility class called ParameterStringBuilder containing a static method, getParamsString(), that transforms a Map into a String of the required format:

`public class ParameterStringBuilder {
    public static String getParamsString(Map<String, String> params) 
      throws UnsupportedEncodingException{
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : params.entrySet()) {
          result.append(URLEncoder.encode(entry.getKey(), "UTF-8"));
          result.append("=");
          result.append(URLEncoder.encode(entry.getValue(), "UTF-8"));
          result.append("&");
        }
        String resultString = result.toString();
        return resultString.length() > 0
          ? resultString.substring(0, resultString.length() - 1)
          : resultString;
    }
}`

- Setting Request Headers:

`con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json");
`
