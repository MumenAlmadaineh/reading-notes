## Object
Objects are states and behavior as in real life , those two are main characteristics that share real life objects.
java using object orienited programming ,and that help to simulate the real objects and even abstart ideas in 
programming .i have example for object in real life , state for dog is age,color,breed ,so those states for example
when u see them in your dog ,u know that this dog is your dog because of the states ,in the other hand, the behavior 
can bark,sleep,Eat those behavior are the actions that this object can do, so states describe the object, and behavior
is the action that this object able to do.

## Classes

![Classes](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/java-class-objects.jpg)

- Everything in Java is associated with classes_

- Class declarations can include these components, in order:
- Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later. (However, note that the private modifier can only be applied to Nested Classes.)
- The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
- The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
- A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
- The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.

## Inheritance

it is like a form of software and we reuse it in which a new class is built from existing class. (Subclass extends a superclass)

## Interface

![Interface](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/difference-between-class-and-interface-in-java.jpg)


It is a reference type in java which contains set of related methods with empty bodies. Interface is used for determine specific common method.

## Package

![Package](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Built-in-packages-in-java.jpg)

Package is a set of classes to makes large software projects easier to manage and we can import them with `import` keyword.

**Number Representationn**
-

We can represent the numbers like:

1. Decimal: has 0 - 9, and to declare number 10 we combine between 1 and 0 and so on.

2. HexaDecimal: system based on 16 symbols from 0-9 then A,B,C,D,E,F. It is represented using 4 digit for the the one number

3. Binary (Machine language): system based on 1 and 0.
