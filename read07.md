### If you are already read the page above we recommend you to read about expressions and operators in JavaScript also because this will give you a good idea about the control flow

[By click here you can read more about expressions and operators in JavaScriptwikipedia.](https://mumenalmadaineh.github.io/reading-notes/read05)

### IF you doing all steps above now you can start reading about the control flow>


## What is the control flow?

### control flow is mean the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.

### Why we use control flow?

### for example if we need to validate user data from a webpage then we must build a script force the user to enter correct information, and we can do this by many way for example by using `while loop statement`

## Example:

````
var correctUserData = prompt("An example of a message that ask the user to enter the correct information");


while (correctUserData != "correctInformation") {
  correctUserData = prompt("What you entered is incorrect, please check and try again" )
}
````

### *In the above example, the user will not be able to access the page data without entering the correct information because while loop statement prevents the browser from reading the rest of the code until the user enters the correct information>*
