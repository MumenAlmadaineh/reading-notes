# Inheritance 
there is class called superclass that contain set of subclasses ,superclass dont have class above it ,subclasses are children of superclass ,that get the properties 
of superclass .
so inheritance are the relation between superclass and subclass , that the property and methods are inherts to subclass from superclass .
as u can see  in below picture ,superclass are the bicycle and subclasses are the different types of bicycles ,so each bicycle has 
the common thing that it take it from superclass.

## Object

What Is an Object?

Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.

Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.

* Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.

Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.

## Class

What Is a Class?

In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

## Interface

![Class](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/difference-between-class-and-interface-in-java.jpg)
 
       interface Bicycle {

          //  wheel revolutions per minute
          void changeCadence(int newValue);

          void changeGear(int newValue);

          void speedUp(int increment);

          void applyBrakes(int decrement);
      }
 is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.
 - Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
 - An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.
 - If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract.
 - A Java library example is Comparator Interface. If a class implements this interface, then it can be used to sort a collection.
 
 ### Interfaces as APIs
 An application programming interface (API), in the context of Java, is a collection of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective methods, fields and constructors.
