# Functional programming

# What is functional programming?
is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

# What is a Pure Function ?
The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program’s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments .

The function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests, input and output devices, or data mutation .

#  What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value

# What is Referential transparency?
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency .



# What is a module?
Module pattern. The Module pattern is used to mimic the concept of classes (since JavaScript doesn’t natively support classes) so that we can store both public and private methods and variables inside a single object

What does the word ‘require’ do?
The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method.



# How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Using require method.


# What do we have to do to make a module available?
We need to export it using module.exports.
