# How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.

# What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

The process of building a React app:
Step 1 - Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

Draw boxes around every component and sub-component in the mock and give them names.
Identify the role of each component.
Separate the UI into components, where each component matches one piece of the data model.
Step 2 - Build A Static Version in React

Building a static version means building a version that takes the data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.
This is done by building components that reuse other components and exchange data using props.
For static versions, props are a way of passing data from parent to child.
Step 3 - Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

The state is used to make the UI interactive as it allows triggering changes to the data model.
The minimal set of app state should be identified.
To define a state, make sure that it represents data that changes over time and can’t be computed from anything else.
Step 4 - Identify Where Your State Should Live

Remember: React has a one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. To figure out which component should own what state:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find a common parent component (a component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
The state should be added in this common parent component or another component higher up that hierarchy.

If it doesn't make sense for the component to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

Step 5 - Add Inverse Data Flow After building an application that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy, support data flow in the other way: from a child components to a higher component in the hierarchy.

Note: components only update their own state

So to inverse the data flow, we will use events to fire a callback function whenever the state should be updated. The state will be updated using the setState() method, and the app will be updated.
