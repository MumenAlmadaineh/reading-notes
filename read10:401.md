  what is a stack? A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

        
  ### The  main method in stack:
  1. Push to add new node in the last
  2. Pop  to remove last node 
  3. Top  it will get the last elemint in the stack 
  4. Peek you will view the value of the top Node
  5. IsEmpty to check if the stack hase Nodes or not 
 
 
Consepts of stack:
1- FILO _first in last out_.
2- LIFO _last in first out_.

2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Consepts of Queue:
