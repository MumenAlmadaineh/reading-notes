# Accessing Data with JPA

- JPA stands for Java Persistent API.  

in this article it talke about how i can build an application that uses Spring Data JPA to store and retrieve data in a relational database.
you can start from scratch or that uses Spring Data JPA to store and retrieve data in a relational database.

## How to Build

---

Initialize the project with properties and its dependencies

- we can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

### Define a Simple Entity

To Create Entity in java, we need to import `import javax.persistence.Entity;` and the following packages:

`import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;`
`import javax.persistence.GenerationType;`
`import javax.persistence.Id;`

For example:

![example of Entity](https://gabrieljeremiahcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/image.png)  

- The `@id` for recognizes it as the objectâ€™s ID.

- The `@GeneratedValue` to indicate that the ID should be generated automatically.

## Create Simple Queries

---

Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database. Its most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface.

- we can extend some Repo in java like: CRUD Repository which includes some methods or define other query methods by declaring their method signature.

## Create an Application Class

---

we can run the simple class for the application which comes with Spring initializr. It contains `@SpringBootApplication` or use the three annotation:  
`@Configuration` then
`@EnableAutoConfiguration` and
`@ComponentScan`.

Next, the simple class from spring Initlizr will modify to be like the function requires.

we can save some customer or fetch an individual/all customers or fetch the customer by searching about the last name.
