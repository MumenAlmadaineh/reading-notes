Why would we use a ternary operator?

To simplify the code and make it easier and more readable because the syntax of The Conditional (Ternary) Operator is more simple than If syntax.
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary

statement:

    if(x===y){
    console.log(true);
    } else {
    console.log(false);
    }


using ternary:

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
