## Java Primitives

Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean.
Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.Every object(reference type) contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type.
as u can see in the below picture :

![Java Primitives](https://www.tutorialcup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DataTypes.png)

-A primitive is not composed of other data types. Where as an object can be and generally is.
-Primitives are passed by value, i.e. a copy of the primitive itself is passed. Whereas for objects,
the copy of the reference is passed, not the object itself.
-Primitives are independent data types, i.e. there does not exist a hierarchy/super class for them.
Whereas every Object is descendent of class "Object"
-Primitives are immutable, they can be used as so without any special care. Whereas for objects,
special care needs to be taken, they are not immutable by default
-With objects, there are two types of copies, Shallow and Deep. There is a significant difference between them.
So the choice depends on how do we intend to use them. With primitives, there is no such difference, everything
is by default deep copy only

there a factor that may decide for u which one to choose , and this factor is memory impact on each one,
so here difference between primitive type and reference type in memory :

-boolean (primitive 1bits vs reference 128bits)
-byte (primitive 8bits vs reference 128bits)
-short,char (primitive 16bits vs reference 128bits)
-int, float (primitive 32bist vs reference 128bits)
-long, double (primitive 64bits vs reference 192bits)



## Java Exceptions

![Java Exceptions](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/java-exceptions-1.png)

- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
- Java uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional events.
- an event that occurs during the exectution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
- using excetions to manage errors has some advantages over traditional error-management techniques.

### How to catch excetion

- By useing try, catch, and finally blocks
- chained exceptions and logging

### Kinds of Exceptions :

checked exception.
the error.
runtime exception.

## Scanning
Scanning for read form user or from file
import java.util.Scanner;
-  The Obj of type `scanner` are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating indivdual tokens according to their data type.

### Map

 Map<K,V>
 object that maps keys to values
 A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
This interface takes the place of the Dictionary class,
 which was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.


## File I/O

![File I/O](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ovKgNGSYe_Q/VhvostH8T4I/AAAAAAAAJKk/PSBy5sWCI2A/s1600/BlockDigm.PNG)
The Java platform provides the scanner API which breaks input into individual tokens associated with bits of data.  

Scanner is a utility class in java.util package and provides several convenient methods to read int, long, String, double etc from a source which can be an InputStream, a file, or a String itself.

>How we can Scanner to read in a file in Java: 
> Scanner has method like **.hasNextLine()** to check if there is a line to read and **.nextLine()** which is read the line from the file.So we can keep read lines until it return null that means this is the end of the file.
