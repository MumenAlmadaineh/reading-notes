# OO Design

![OO Design](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/software-engineering/images/software-engineering-object-oriented-design.png)

In the object-oriented design method, the system is viewed as a collection of objects (i.e., entities). The state is distributed among the objects, and each object handles its state data. For example, in a Library Automation Software, each library representative may be a separate object with its data and functions to operate on these data. The tasks defined for one purpose cannot refer or change data of other objects. Objects have their internal data which represent their state. Similar objects create a class. In other words, each object is a member of some class. Classes may inherit features from the superclass.

-DRY principle stand for (Dont repeat Yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,
replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.example for that in code , dont write the same code alot 
,try to reduce of unessary code .


# Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
It's a way that aimed to reduce the redundant data by using one 2 wayes, replacing it with abstractions, or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. 
 "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

#### WET  opposing view to DRY that's means "write everything twice"
#### AHA  "avoid hasty abstractions"

# Rule of three (computer programming)
"Three strikes and you refactor" is a code refactoring rule of thumb
Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain. When the rule encoded in a 
  replicated piece of code changes, whoever maintains the code will have to change it in all places correctly.
  
cost of maintenance certainly outweighs the cost of refactoring and potential bad design when there are three copies, and may or may not if there are only two copies.


# You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)
as a programmer, you should not add functionality until deemed necessary, do the simplest work that you can.
add functionality until deemed necessary. Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it".


# Minimum viable product (MVP) 
is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.
and this version is not the last, it's just to try and have feedback.
developers should potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work.
Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.
